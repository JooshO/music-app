# music-app

A simple electron app for playing and managing youtube music on the desktop

Intended mainly for RPG sessions and easy audio management

If working from source code, requires calling electron packager via `npx electron-packager . --overwrite`
You may also have to change the cwd option in main.js to match the generated folder

CURRENT STATE: Save/load may be breaking things a little, WIP
